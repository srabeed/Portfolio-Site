	<p>I'm a software engineer currently studying Computer Science at the University of Texas at Austin. 
	I am most interested in full stack development and enjoy creating beautiful, responsive layouts for my clients. 
	In my free time, I also enjoy woodworking, making music, and photography. Feel free to explore my projects and this site.
